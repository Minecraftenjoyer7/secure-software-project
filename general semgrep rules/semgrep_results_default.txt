          A hard-coded credential was detected. It is not recommended to store credentials in source-code, as
          this risks secrets being leaked and used by either an internal or external malicious adversary. It 
          is recommended to use environment variables to securely provide credentials or retrieve credentials
          from a secure vault or HSM (Hardware Security Module).
